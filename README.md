Reminders: 
1. The live link will only get you to the login page. Even you have an access code you can't login. Github can only show a simple html, css and javascript files. Another reason It can't access the database. 
2. Source code: It is the compilation of static files.

Live App: https://ramoncarlofrancisco.github.io/tracker_app/

#Important Notice

Live Demo Limitations:

The live link will only display the login page. Even with valid access credentials, login functionality is disabled because GitHub Pages cannot execute server-side code or connect to databases.
This repository contains static files only - the complete system requires a PHP server environment to function properly.

GitHub Pages Limitations

GitHub Pages can only serve static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Since this system is built with PHP and requires database connectivity, the live demo is non-functional on GitHub Pages.
