Live App: https://ramoncarlofrancisco.github.io/tracker_app/

#Important Notice

Live Demo Limitations:

The live link will only display the login page. Even with valid access credentials, login functionality is disabled because GitHub Pages cannot execute server-side code or connect to databases.
This repository contains static files only - the complete system requires a PHP server environment to function properly.

GitHub Pages Limitations

GitHub Pages can only serve static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Since this system is built with PHP and requires database connectivity, the live demo is non-functional on GitHub Pages.
