Live App: https://ramoncarlofrancisco.github.io/tracker_app/

Reminders: 
1. The live link will only get you to the login page. Even you have an access code you can't login. Github can only show a simple html, css and javascript files. Another reason It can't access the database. 
2. Source code: It is the compilation of static files.
